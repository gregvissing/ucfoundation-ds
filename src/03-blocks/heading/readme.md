# Headings

Headings are `<hX>` agnostic, so the application of the `.heading` class should affect any element it is applied to. It is recommended to follow a hierarchy as much as possible.

## Exceptions with baked in sizes

All elements can be affected by using the [size scale](/components/detail/size-scale), but the following [Exceptions](https://piccalil.li/cube-css/exception/) will size things out of the box: `data-type="secondary"` and `data-type="tertiary"`.
