# Nav

Arranges a list of links into a fully repsonsive navigation.

## Implementation

If there are more than one `<nav>` elements on a page, you **must** add an `aria-label` to at least one of them (ideally all of them), so the differentiation is announced to screen readers.

For example:

```html
<nav aria-label="primary"></nav>
```
